			<description>My thoughts I always wanted to setup a blog and keep updating the best practice which learned from work(in eBay) and self study. By which other peoples may benefit on this, even a little help will make me feel huge proud.
We used to search on the internet when we are facing issues. We keep dig and dig, try again and again to resolve the problem. A commen case is there are many blogs are just paste from anothor, if we clicked into it, means very time wasting.</description>

<p>I always wanted to setup a blog and keep updating the best practice which learned from work(in eBay) and self study. By which other peoples may benefit on this, even a little help will make me feel huge proud.</p>
<p>We used to search on the internet when we are facing issues. We keep dig and dig, try again and again to resolve the problem. A commen case is there are many blogs are just paste from anothor, if we clicked into it, means very time wasting. So I will always write original blogs, and don’t forget the initial purpose.</p>
<p>Now let me begin recording my struggling blog build road. I had to say the quick_start part in hugo document is not friendly… The blank site on localhost:1313 drives me crasy..</p>
<h2 id="install-hugo-and-its-based-program-language-go">Install <code>hugo</code> and its based program language <code>Go</code></h2>
<h3 id="go">Go</h3>
<p>You can google <em>Go install</em>,  download .dmg and install. That’s quiet easy.</p>
<h3 id="hugo">hugo</h3>
<pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre><h2 id="create-site-and-add-your-favorate-theme">Create site and add your favorate theme</h2>
<p>create main folder by hugo new command.</p>
<pre><code>hugo new site your_site_name
</code></pre><p>cd your_site_name, then clone your favorate hugo them into themes/.</p>
<pre><code>cd your_site_name
git clone https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git themes/hermit
</code></pre><p>create some web pages in .md format, following commands will automatically generate subfolder names <em>posts</em> and <em>about</em>.</p>
<pre><code>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
hugo new about/about.md
</code></pre><p>Ather this, hugo ducument says <code>hugo server -D</code>
But I saw nothing when opened http://localhost:1313/
After a huge struggling, I finally saw the contents.</p>
<p>Needed actions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove draft line in *.md you just created, hugo won’t deploy drafts unless you append this command <code>--buildDrafts</code>.
However, after I made change accordingly, website still is blank.</li>
<li>Paste <code>config.toml</code>  from your <code>themes/theme_name/exampleSite</code>folder to your site main folder. And modify same customer settings, I am only listing necessary parts:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>baseURL = &quot;https://Thunsis.github.io&quot;
# your github.io url
theme = &quot;hermit&quot;
# them name
[menu]

  [[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;Posts&quot;
    url = &quot;posts/&quot;
    weight = 10

  [[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;About&quot;
    url = &quot;about/&quot;
    weight = 20
# menu stucture, need to be aligned with .md files you created
</code></pre><p>Now you can see the website by, congratulations!</p>
<pre><code>hugo server -D
</code></pre><h2 id="deploy-to-github-repo">Deploy to github repo</h2>
<p>We have get blog ready in localhost, but there still a way to go.. Carry on!</p>
<h3 id="create-your_namegithubio-repo-and-configure-it">Create your_name.github.io repo and configure it</h3>
<p>I won’t go into details on creating repo names <code>your_name.github.io</code>, there is a important action need, which is to create a file names <code>.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml</code> under your just created repo. The content should be:</p>
<pre><code>name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Set a branch to deploy

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)
          fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          # extended: true

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
</code></pre><h3 id="generate-static-files-and-push-to-repo">Generate static files and push to repo</h3>
<p>After this command, static files will be generated to hugo project subfolder names <em>public</em>. Which is the exact content we need to deploy to github repo.</p>
<pre><code>hugo
</code></pre><p>Now we push it into repo.</p>
<pre><code>cd public
git remote add origin https://github.com/Thunsis/Thunsis.github.io.git
git add .
git commit -a -m 'my blog'
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>See you blog on <code>http://your_name.github.io/</code>, cheers!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="the-mosting-blocking-issues">The mosting blocking issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>hugo document did not tell us to overwrite  <code>config.toml</code> by theme’s, which caused I can’t see the content.</li>
<li>Muti github account issue(personal issue). But I have found best solution, will post another blog to summary that. I think it could be helpful by some people, because most of us have company github account and personal github account both on same laptop.</li>
</ul>
