      <description>My thoughts I always wanted to setup a blog and keep updating the best practice which I learned from work(in eBay) and self study. It may be helpful by other peoples who met issue and clicked into this page. I would be very proud of this.
We used to search on the internet when we are facing issues. We keep digging and digging, trying again and again to resolve problems. A common case is many blogs are just pasted from anothor, that is very time wasting once we realised.</description>
