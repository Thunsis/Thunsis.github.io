      <description>View in spark is a powerful data layer, on which you can apply flexciable logics and control data visibility as well as orgnaize different sources together.
I made lots of practice on view, it is worth to summarize the notice points on view advance usage. Before that, I did mutiple testing to make sure it is as correct as possible.
Scope View not only could be a intermedia temporary code block, but also can be built permanently based on user requirements.</description>
