      <description>My thoughts I always wanted to setup a blog and keep updating the best practice which learned from work(in eBay) and self study. By which other peoples may benefit on this, even a little help will make me feel huge proud.
We used to search on the internet when we are facing issues. We keep dig and dig, try again and again to resolve the problem. A commen case is there are many blogs are just paste from anothor, if we clicked into it, means very time wasting.</description>
